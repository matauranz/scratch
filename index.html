06:42:19	 From  Mike B Hamilton, NZ : If circumstances warrant, we ask our wives or friends to join us in morning meditation. If we belong to a religious denomination which requires a definite morning devotion, we attend to that also. If not members of religious bodies, we sometimes select and memorize a few set prayers which emphasize the principles we have been discussing. There are many helpful books also. Suggestions about these may be obtained from one‚Äôs priest, minister, or rabbi. Be quick to see where religious people are right. Make use of what they offer.

06:46:48	 From  Bruce C. (Phoenix, Az.)  to  Stephen  listening(Privately) : Ten Things to Let Go of in Order to Reach Unlimited Happiness
1. Let go of all thoughts that don‚Äôt make you feel empowered and strong.
2. Let go of feeling guilty for doing what you truly want to do.
3. Let go of the fear of the unknown; take one small step and watch the path reveal itself.
4. Let go of regrets; at one point in your life, that ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù was exactly what you wanted and needed.
5. Let go of worrying; worrying is like praying to receive what you don‚Äôt want.
6. Let go of blaming anyone for anything; be accountable for your own life. If you don‚Äôt like something, you have two choices: Accept it or change it.
7. Let go of thinking you are damaged; you matter, and the world needs you just as you are.
8. Let go of thinking your dreams are not important; always follow your heart.
9. Let go of being the ‚Äúgo‚Äëto person‚Äù for everyone, all the time; stop blowing yourself off and take care of you first . . . because you matter.

10. Let go of thinking everyone else is happier, more successful, or better off
